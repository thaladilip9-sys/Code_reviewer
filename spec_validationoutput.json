We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the exact requirements laid out in the YAML.\n\n### Rule Analysis\n\n#### NAM-001: Function Naming (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Functions should be named using `snake_case`, which means they should start with a lowercase letter and can include lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The pattern to follow is `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check if all function names in the three files adhere to this pattern.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If we find a function named `myFunction`, it would violate this rule because it uses `CamelCase` instead of `snake_case`.\n  - Conversely, a function named `my_function` would comply perfectly with the rule.\n\n#### NAM-002: Class Naming (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Classes should be named using `PascalCase`, meaning they should start with an uppercase letter and can include uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. The pattern to follow is `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to examine the class names in the code to see if they follow this convention.\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - A class named `MyClass` would be compliant, as it starts with an uppercase letter and follows the `PascalCase` format.\n  - However, if we find a class named `my_class`, it would not comply because it uses `snake_case` instead of `PascalCase`.\n\n#### NAM-003: Constant Naming (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Constants should be named using `UPPER_CASE`, which means they should consist of uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The pattern to follow is `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We will look for constants in the code to see if they adhere to this naming convention.\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - A constant named `MAX_CONNECTIONS` would comply with this rule, as it uses all uppercase letters and underscores.\n  - On the other hand, a constant named `max_connections` would not comply because it uses lowercase letters.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, we need to carefully check each of the three files (`auth.py`, `sample.py`, and `utils.py`) for function names, class names, and constants to ensure they adhere to the specified naming conventions. By following the rules laid out in the YAML, we can maintain a clean and consistent codebase. Let's keep our eyes peeled for those naming patterns!",

We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the exact requirements laid out in the YAML.\n\n### STR-001: Function Length\n- **What the rule requires:** Functions should not exceed 50 lines in length.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check the length of each function in the provided files.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Since we don't have the actual function definitions, we can't directly assess their lengths. However, given that the files are relatively large (auth.py at 5438 chars, sample.py at 2923 chars, and utils.py at 3891 chars), it's possible that some functions may exceed the 50-line limit. \n  - If any function in these files is longer than 50 lines, it would be a violation of this rule.\n\n### STR-002: Class Length\n- **What the rule requires:** Classes should not exceed 200 lines in length.\n- **Whether the code complies:** Similar to functions, we need to evaluate the length of each class.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Again, without the actual class definitions, we can't pinpoint their lengths. However, the total character count of the files suggests that there could be classes that might be lengthy. \n  - If any class exceeds 200 lines, it would not comply with this rule.\n\n### STR-003: Method Complexity\n- **What the rule requires:** Methods should have low cyclomatic complexity.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to analyze the complexity of each method.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Without the specific method implementations, we can't measure their cyclomatic complexity directly. However, if any method has multiple branches or complex logic, it could lead to high complexity, which would violate this rule.\n  - A method with a high number of conditional statements or loops would be a clear example of non-compliance.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while we can't definitively state compliance without the actual function and class definitions, the large character counts in the files raise concerns about potential violations of the specified rules. Each rule emphasizes the importance of keeping functions and classes concise and methods straightforward. To ensure adherence, a thorough review of the actual code is necessary to check for function lengths, class lengths, and method complexities.",

If any function is found without a docstring, it would indicate a failure to comply with DOC-001.\n\n### Rule DOC-002: Class Docstrings\n- **What the rule requires:** Every class in the code must have a docstring that describes its purpose and functionality.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to verify if all classes across the three files have appropriate docstrings.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - For example, if `class User:` in `auth.py` does not have a docstring explaining what the `User` class represents, that would be a violation of this rule.\n  - We would also check `sample.py` and `utils.py` for any classes that might be missing docstrings. If a class like `class DataProcessor:` lacks a docstring, it would indicate non-compliance with DOC-002.\n\n### Rule DOC-003: Module Docstrings\n- **What the rule requires:** Each module (file) should have a docstring at the top that provides an overview of the module's purpose.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to see if each of the three files starts with a module docstring.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If `auth.py` does not start with a docstring like `\"\"\"This module handles authentication processes.\"\"\"`, it would not comply with this rule.\n  - The same goes for `sample.py` and `utils.py`. If either of these files lacks a module docstring, it would be a clear violation of DOC-003.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, we need to carefully check each of the three files for compliance with the specified documentation rules. If any functions, classes, or modules are missing their required docstrings, we will have identified areas for improvement. This analysis is crucial for maintaining clear and understandable code, ensuring that future developers can easily grasp the functionality and purpose of each component. Happy coding!",

                "streaming_content": "Let's dive into the error handling of the provided Python code by analyzing it against the YAML specification rules. We'll break it down step-by-step for clarity!\n\n### Rule Analysis\n\n#### ERR-001: Specific Exceptions (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule mandates that developers should use specific exceptions instead of a bare `except`. This helps in identifying the exact type of error that occurred, making debugging easier and improving code reliability.\n- **Does the code comply?** We need to check if the code uses specific exceptions or if it falls back on a generic `except`.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** Without the actual code snippets, we can't pinpoint exact instances. However, if the code uses `except:` without specifying the exception type, it would be a violation of this rule. If it uses specific exceptions like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc., then it complies.\n\n#### ERR-002: Exception Messages (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule states that exceptions should have descriptive messages. This is crucial because a well-defined message can provide context about what went wrong, making it easier for developers to understand and fix issues.\n- **Does the code comply?** We need to look for any exception handling in the code and see if the messages provided are descriptive enough.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** Again, without the actual code, we can't provide specific examples. If the code raises exceptions with vague messages like \"Error occurred\" or \"Something went wrong,\" it would not comply. On the other hand, if it includes messages that explain the context, such as \"File not found: auth.py,\" it would meet the requirement.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, to fully assess the error handling in the provided Python code, we would need to see the actual exception handling implementations. If the code uses specific exceptions and provides descriptive messages, it aligns well with the YAML specification rules. If it defaults to bare `except` statements or vague messages, it would need improvement to meet the standards set forth in the YAML rules. \n\nFeel free to share the code snippets for a more detailed analysis!",

We'll break it down step-by-step for clarity!\n\n### SEC-001: Input Validation (critical severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule mandates that all user inputs must be validated to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints. This is crucial to prevent issues like injection attacks or unexpected behavior in the application.\n  \n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check if the code in `auth.py`, `sample.py`, and `utils.py` validates user inputs effectively.\n\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If we look into `auth.py`, we should be on the lookout for any functions that handle user input, such as login forms or registration data. If there are no checks to validate the format of email addresses or passwords, then it would be a compliance failure.\n  - In `sample.py`, if there are any functions that accept parameters from users (like command-line arguments or web requests), we need to see if they are being sanitized or validated. For instance, if a function accepts a username, it should check for length and allowed characters.\n  - Lastly, in `utils.py`, if there are utility functions that process user data, we should ensure they include validation checks. If they simply process data without any validation, that would also indicate non-compliance.\n\n### SEC-002: No Hardcoded Secrets (critical severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule states that no sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, should be hardcoded directly into the source code. This is vital to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to scrutinize all three files for any hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - In `auth.py`, if there are any lines where API keys or database passwords are directly written in the code (e.g., `API_KEY = \"my_secret_key\"`), that would be a clear violation of this rule.\n  - Moving on to `sample.py`, we should check for any instances where sensitive information might be included, such as in configuration settings or function parameters.\n  - Finally, in `utils.py`, if there are any constants or variables that store sensitive information, we need to flag those as non-compliant.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, we need to carefully analyze each of the three files for compliance with the specified security rules. The first rule about input validation is critical for safeguarding against various attacks, while the second rule about hardcoded secrets is essential for protecting sensitive information. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the code adheres to best security practices!",

                "streaming_content": "Let's dive into the performance analysis of the provided Python code, focusing on how well it adheres to the YAML specification rules. We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the requirements laid out in the YAML.\n\n### Rule PER-001: Efficient Data Structures (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule emphasizes the importance of using appropriate data structures for various operations within the code. The goal is to ensure that the chosen data structures enhance performance and efficiency.\n  \n- **Whether the code complies:** Without the actual content of the files (auth.py, sample.py, and utils.py), we can't definitively assess compliance. However, we can discuss what to look for.\n  \n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If the code uses lists for operations that require frequent lookups, it may not comply, as dictionaries or sets would be more efficient in such cases.\n  - If there are instances of using tuples for immutable collections where lists are used unnecessarily, that could also indicate a lack of adherence to this rule.\n  - Look for any nested loops that could be optimized with better data structures, such as using a dictionary to avoid repeated searches.\n\n### Rule PER-002: Database Query Optimization (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule is critical and mandates that all database queries must be optimized. This means ensuring that queries are efficient, possibly by using indexing, avoiding unnecessary data retrieval, and minimizing the number of queries made to the database.\n  \n- **Whether the code complies:** Again, without the actual code, we can't confirm compliance. However, we can outline what to check for.\n  \n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - Look for any SQL queries that retrieve more data than necessary. For instance, if a query fetches all columns from a table when only a few are needed, it would not comply.\n  - Check for the use of joins. If the code performs multiple queries instead of a single optimized join, it may not meet the requirement.\n  - Ensure that there are no repeated queries within loops, as this can severely impact performance. Instead, using batch queries or caching results would be more efficient.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while we can't definitively state whether the code complies with the YAML rules without seeing the actual implementation, we can highlight the key areas to focus on for each rule. For PER-001, look for the appropriateness of data structures used, and for PER-002, scrutinize the efficiency of database queries. By addressing these points, the code can be improved to meet the performance standards set forth in the YAML specification.",
