We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the exact requirements laid out in the YAML.\n\n### Rule Analysis\n\n#### NAM-001: Function Naming (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Functions should be named using `snake_case`, which means they should start with a lowercase letter and can include lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The pattern to follow is `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check if all function names in the three files adhere to this naming convention.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If we find a function named `myFunction`, it would violate this rule because it uses `CamelCase` instead of `snake_case`.\n  - Conversely, a function named `my_function` would comply perfectly with the rule.\n\n#### NAM-002: Class Naming (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Classes should be named using `PascalCase`, meaning they should start with an uppercase letter and can include uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. The pattern to follow is `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We will look for class names in the code to see if they follow this convention.\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - A class named `MyClass` would be compliant, as it starts with an uppercase letter and follows the `PascalCase` format.\n  - However, if we find a class named `my_class`, it would not comply since it uses `snake_case` instead of `PascalCase`.\n\n#### NAM-003: Constant Naming (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Constants should be named using `UPPER_CASE`, which means they should consist of uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The pattern to follow is `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We will check for any constants in the code to see if they adhere to this naming convention.\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - A constant named `MAX_CONNECTIONS` would comply with the rule, as it is fully in uppercase and uses underscores appropriately.\n  - On the other hand, a constant named `maxConnections` would not comply because it uses `CamelCase` instead of `UPPER_CASE`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy analyzing the code against these three naming convention rules, we can determine how well it adheres to the specified standards. Each rule has its own requirements, and compliance can be easily checked through specific examples found in the code. Remember, following these conventions not only helps in maintaining code quality but also enhances readability and collaboration among developers!",

We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the guidelines and provide clear insights.\n\n### STR-001: Function Length\n- **What the rule requires:** Functions should not exceed 50 lines in length. This helps maintain readability and manageability of the code.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check the individual functions in the provided files to see if any exceed the 50-line limit.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Since we don't have the actual function definitions, we can't pinpoint specific functions. However, if any function in `auth.py`, `sample.py`, or `utils.py` exceeds 50 lines, it would be a violation of this rule. We would need to review each file to confirm compliance.\n\n### STR-002: Class Length\n- **What the rule requires:** Classes should not exceed 200 lines. This ensures that classes remain focused and easier to understand.\n- **Whether the code complies:** Similar to the function length, we need to examine the classes in the provided files.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Again, without the actual class definitions, we can't identify specific classes. If any class in `auth.py`, `sample.py`, or `utils.py` exceeds 200 lines, it would violate this rule. A thorough review of each class is necessary to ensure compliance.\n\n### STR-003: Method Complexity\n- **What the rule requires:** Methods should have low cyclomatic complexity. This means that methods should be straightforward and not overly complicated, making them easier to test and maintain.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to analyze the methods in the files to determine their cyclomatic complexity.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - Without the actual method implementations, we can't assess their complexity. If any method in the files has high cyclomatic complexity (for example, if it contains many conditional statements or loops), it would not comply with this rule. A detailed examination of each method is required to ensure they meet the low complexity standard.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while we have outlined the requirements of each rule, we need to conduct a detailed review of the actual code in `auth.py`, `sample.py`, and `utils.py` to determine compliance. Each rule focuses on maintaining clarity and simplicity in the code structure, which is essential for effective software development. If any functions, classes, or methods do not adhere to these specifications, they would need to be refactored to align with the YAML rules.",

We'll break it down according to the YAML specification rules you've provided. \n\n### Rule Analysis\n\n#### DOC-001: Function Docstrings (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Every function in the code must have a docstring that explains its purpose and usage.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check if all functions in the three files have appropriate docstrings.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If `auth.py` contains functions like `def login():`, we should see a docstring immediately following the function definition, such as `\"\"\"Logs a user into the system.\"\"\"`. \n  - If any function lacks a docstring, it would be a violation of this rule.\n\n#### DOC-002: Class Docstrings (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Every class in the code must have a docstring that describes its functionality.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We will look for classes in each file to see if they have docstrings.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - For instance, if `class User:` is defined in `auth.py`, it should be followed by a docstring like `\"\"\"Represents a user in the system.\"\"\"`. \n  - If any class is missing this documentation, it would not comply with the rule.\n\n#### DOC-003: Module Docstrings (low severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** Each module (file) should have a docstring at the top that provides an overview of the module's purpose.\n- **Whether the code complies:** We will check if each of the three files starts with a module docstring.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - For example, `auth.py` should begin with something like `\"\"\"This module handles authentication processes.\"\"\"`. \n  - If any of the files lack this initial docstring, it would be a breach of this rule.\n\n### Summary of Compliance\n- **auth.py:** \n  - Check for function and class docstrings. If any are missing, it violates DOC-001 and DOC-002.\n  - Ensure there's a module docstring at the top for compliance with DOC-003.\n  \n- **sample.py:** \n  - Similar checks for function and class docstrings as in `auth.py`.\n  - Verify the presence of a module docstring at the beginning.\n\n- **utils.py:** \n  - Again, look for function and class docstrings.\n  - Confirm that a module docstring is present at the top of the file.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following this structured approach, we can determine how well the code adheres to the YAML specification rules regarding documentation. Each rule is crucial for maintaining clarity and usability in the codebase, so it's essential to ensure compliance across all three files. Happy coding!",

We'll break it down step-by-step for clarity!\n\n### Rule Analysis\n\n#### ERR-001: Specific Exceptions (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule mandates that developers should use specific exceptions instead of a bare `except`. This helps in identifying the exact type of error that occurred, making debugging easier and improving code reliability.\n- **Does the code comply?** We need to check if the code uses specific exceptions or if it falls back on a generic `except`.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** Unfortunately, without the actual code snippets, we can't pinpoint whether specific exceptions are used. If the code uses `except:` without specifying the exception type, it would violate this rule. If it uses exceptions like `except ValueError:` or `except FileNotFoundError:`, then it complies.\n\n#### ERR-002: Exception Messages (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule states that exceptions should have descriptive messages. This is crucial for understanding what went wrong when an exception is raised, as it provides context to the error.\n- **Does the code comply?** We need to look for any exception handling in the code that includes messages. If exceptions are raised without messages or with vague messages, it would not meet the requirement.\n- **Specific examples from the code:** Again, without the actual code, we can't provide specific examples. If the code raises exceptions like `raise ValueError(\"Invalid input provided\")`, it complies. However, if it raises exceptions with no message or a generic message like `raise ValueError()`, it would not comply.\n\n### Summary\n- For **ERR-001**, we need to verify if specific exceptions are used. If the code uses bare `except`, it does not comply.\n- For **ERR-002**, we need to check if exceptions have descriptive messages. If they lack clarity, it does not comply.\n\nIn conclusion, to fully assess the compliance with the YAML specification, we would need to see the actual exception handling code. This analysis highlights the importance of using specific exceptions and providing clear messages to enhance error handling in Python code!",

We'll break it down step-by-step for clarity!\n\n### SEC-001: Input Validation (critical severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule mandates that all user inputs must be validated to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints. This is crucial to prevent malicious data from being processed by the application.\n  \n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to check if the code in `auth.py`, `sample.py`, and `utils.py` validates user inputs effectively.\n\n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If `auth.py` contains functions that accept user credentials, we should look for checks that ensure these inputs are not only present but also conform to expected patterns (like email formats or password strength).\n  - In `sample.py`, if there are any functions that take user input (like form submissions), we should see validation logic that checks for valid data types and ranges.\n  - For `utils.py`, any utility functions that process user data should also include validation steps to ensure that the data is safe to use.\n\n### SEC-002: No Hardcoded Secrets (critical severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule specifies that no sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, should be hardcoded directly into the source code. This is vital for protecting sensitive data from being exposed in version control or through code leaks.\n\n- **Whether the code complies:** We need to scrutinize all three files for any instances of hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - In `auth.py`, if there are any lines where API keys or database passwords are directly written into the code, that would be a violation of this rule.\n  - `sample.py` should be checked for any hardcoded credentials, especially if it interacts with external services.\n  - Lastly, `utils.py` should be examined for any constants or variables that might store sensitive information without proper management.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, we need to ensure that the code adheres to both SEC-001 and SEC-002 rules. By validating all user inputs and avoiding hardcoded secrets, the code can significantly enhance its security posture. Each file should be carefully reviewed to identify compliance or violations, ensuring that the application remains robust against potential security threats.",

                "streaming_content": "Let's dive into the performance analysis of the provided Python code, focusing on how well it adheres to the YAML specification rules. We'll break it down rule by rule, ensuring we stick to the requirements laid out in the YAML.\n\n### Rule PER-001: Efficient Data Structures (medium severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule emphasizes the importance of using appropriate data structures for various operations within the code. The goal is to ensure that the chosen data structures enhance performance and efficiency.\n  \n- **Whether the code complies:** Without the actual content of the files (auth.py, sample.py, and utils.py), we can't definitively assess compliance. However, we can discuss what to look for in the code.\n  \n- **Specific examples from the code:** \n  - If the code uses lists for frequent lookups, it may not comply, as sets or dictionaries would be more efficient.\n  - If there are operations that involve large datasets, check if tuples or namedtuples are used instead of lists for better performance.\n  - Look for instances where data structures like queues or stacks are implemented; if they are not used appropriately, it could indicate non-compliance.\n\n### Rule PER-002: Database Query Optimization (high severity)\n- **What the rule requires:** This rule mandates that database queries must be optimized. This is crucial for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-frequency queries. Compliance is required, meaning that any inefficiencies in database interactions must be addressed.\n\n- **Whether the code complies:** Again, without the actual code, we can't confirm compliance. However, we can outline what to check for.\n  \n- **Specific examples from the code:**\n  - Look for the use of indexes in database queries. If queries are made on non-indexed columns, this would be a clear violation of the rule.\n  - Check for the use of joins; if they are not optimized or if unnecessary data is being fetched, it could indicate a lack of compliance.\n  - Review the use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools. If they are not being used effectively, or if raw SQL queries are poorly constructed, this could lead to performance issues.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while we can't definitively state whether the code complies with the YAML rules without seeing the actual implementation, we can highlight the key areas to focus on for each rule. For PER-001, ensure that the data structures used are the most efficient for the operations being performed. For PER-002, scrutinize the database queries for optimization opportunities. By addressing these areas, the code can significantly improve its performance.",
